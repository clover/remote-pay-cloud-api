@types/remote-pay-cloud-api

*** Important: When the model updates these typings need to be manually updated and published.
*** These typings are published separately from remote-pay-cloud-api!

Manually generated typings for remote-pay-cloud-api.  I attempted to use tools that auto-generate the typings (dts-gen, etc.) but they were insufficient.

Note: The long-term goal is to generate TypeScript from Avro so that we do not have to maintain these typings.
